I was worried that things would slow down too much after free week, but it was
actually very helpful. This week we focused on doing the basics and doing them
right. We went over the things we learned during free week and learned the
correct way to do them. It was nice, and I feel like I have a much more solid
foundation and a better idea on the stylistic difference between the different
dances. I know a decent amount of west coast swing, so I felt like that lesson
in particular was slow, but I know that there are technique things that are
important that I should focus on. I'll probably use this as an opportunity to
work on leading, leg line, rolling through, and making the dance look right.
