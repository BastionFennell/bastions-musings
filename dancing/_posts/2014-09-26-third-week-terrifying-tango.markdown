So, I didn't get a chance to go to waltz or tango the first two weeks, but I
decided to try and jump in on it before it was too late. It was... intense...
Waltz was nice, but I didn't figure out how to do the basic moves until the
very end of the lesson, and even then I was kind of shaky. Tango was even
worse. Everyone else was focusing on making it look right, while I was
focusing of getting the footwork down. Still, the instructor focused on the
basics and getting them right, so it was bearable. I should find a partner to
practice tango and waltz with so I can get up to speed. Aside from those two
classes, we were making sure we had our basics down and adding a few of the
more iconic moves for each of the dances. Things like the fan in rumba and the
spinning left side pass in west coast swing. It was fun, hopefully I'll figure
out tango and waltz soon.
