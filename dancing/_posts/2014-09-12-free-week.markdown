This will be a short post. I went to Texas Ballroom's free week, and it was
pretty crazy. The room was literally full of people, all of us trying to
figure out how to dance. The lessons were all pretty rushed because the
instructors were trying to get us to something that felt like dancing as
quickly as possible. I've been assured several times that there will be less
people next week, we'll see what happens. I almost went to my first social
dance, but ended up deciding against it at the end. I feel like I should know more
than the basic before I dance socially.
