pretty terrible at it. It’s a really fast waltz, and I wasn’t prepared for the
speed at all. It’s so fast, it only has seven moves total in the gold
syllabus. We learned all of them, but I was pretty terrible at most of them…
I’ll practice this week, and hopefully I’ll be ready in time.

    <p>Next weekend, the Texas Ballroom club is hosting The Great Waltz, which is
apparently one of their biggest events of the year. They’re going to have a
live orchestra that will be playing a lot of viennese waltz. So, to prepare, I
went to a viennese waltz workshop on Saturday to prepare. Turns out, I’m
pretty terrible at it. It’s a really fast waltz, and I wasn’t prepared for the

<p>More interesting news, I think I’m going to try competing in November. I’m not
sure what I’m going to compete in yet, but I’m planning on going to Dances
with Owls at Rice University. Right now, I’m trying to decide if I want to
compete in newcomer or bronze, and what dances I want to do. My partner is
more familiar with smooth and rhythm, but I’m more familiar with standard and
latin. We’ll talk about it, and I’ll give an update next week. Until then!</p>
